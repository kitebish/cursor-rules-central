# Project-Specific Rules Template

**IMPORTANT**: This file is gitignored and should be customized for each project.

---

## Project Context

### Project Name
[e.g., Customer Portal v2]

### Customer/Client
[e.g., Acme Corporation]

### Tech Stack
- Frontend: [e.g., React 18, TypeScript]
- Backend: [e.g., Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL]
- Deployment: [e.g., AWS, Docker]

### Project Type
[e.g., E-commerce platform, Internal dashboard, Mobile app backend]

---

## Customer-Specific Requirements

### Naming Conventions
[Any customer-specific naming that differs from company standards]

Example:
- Use "Client" instead of "Customer" in all user-facing text
- API endpoints must use kebab-case (customer requirement)
- Database tables must have "tbl_" prefix

### Business Rules
[Customer-specific business logic that AI should know]

Example:
- Orders over $1000 require manager approval
- Users in "Premium" tier get free shipping
- Refunds only allowed within 30 days

### Compliance Requirements
[Any regulatory or compliance needs]

Example:
- GDPR compliance required
- PCI-DSS for payment processing
- HIPAA for health data

---

## Architecture Decisions

### State Management
[How state is managed in this project]

Example:
- Use Redux for global state
- Use React Query for server state
- Local state with useState for UI-only state

### API Design
[API patterns used in this project]

Example:
- RESTful API with versioning (/api/v1/)
- Use JWT for authentication
- Pagination: limit/offset pattern

### Database Schema
[Key database design decisions]

Example:
- Soft deletes (deleted_at column)
- UUID primary keys
- Audit columns: created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by

---

## Third-Party Integrations

### Payment Gateway
[e.g., Stripe, PayPal]
- API Key location: [e.g., process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY]
- Webhook endpoint: [e.g., /api/webhooks/stripe]

### Email Service
[e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES]
- Templates location: [e.g., /templates/emails/]
- From address: [e.g., noreply@customer.com]

### External APIs
[List any external APIs used]
- Weather API: [endpoint, auth method]
- Maps API: [endpoint, auth method]

---

## File Organization

### Custom Folder Structure
[Any project-specific folder organization]

Example:
```
src/
├── features/          # Feature-based organization
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── products/
│   └── orders/
├── shared/            # Shared components
└── legacy/            # Legacy code (to be refactored)
```

### Import Aliases
[Path aliases configured in this project]

Example:
```typescript
import { Button } from '@/components/Button';
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useAuth';
import { API_URL } from '@/config';
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Requirements
[Project-specific test requirements]

Example:
- Minimum 80% coverage for business logic
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Visual regression tests for UI components

### Test Data
[How to handle test data]

Example:
- Use factories for test data generation
- Seed database with: `npm run db:seed:test`
- Mock external APIs in tests

---

## Deployment

### Environments
1. **Development**: [URL, purpose]
2. **Staging**: [URL, purpose]
3. **Production**: [URL, purpose]

### Environment Variables
[Project-specific env vars]

Example:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.customer.com
REACT_APP_ANALYTICS_ID=UA-XXXXX-Y
CUSTOMER_FEATURE_FLAG=true
```

### Deployment Process
[How to deploy this project]

Example:
1. Create PR to `develop` branch
2. Automated tests run
3. Manual QA on staging
4. Merge to `main` triggers production deployment

---

## Known Issues / Workarounds

### Browser Compatibility
[Any known browser issues]

Example:
- IE11 not supported (customer approved)
- Safari date picker requires polyfill

### Performance Considerations
[Performance-related notes]

Example:
- Product images must be optimized (use WebP)
- Lazy load product list (customer has 10,000+ products)
- Cache API responses for 5 minutes

### Technical Debt
[Known technical debt to be aware of]

Example:
- Legacy authentication system (migration planned Q2)
- Old API endpoints (v1) still in use, deprecate by June
- Database needs indexing on orders table

### Key People
- **Product Owner**: [Name, contact]
- **Tech Lead**: [Name, contact]
- **DevOps**: [Name, contact]

### Communication
- **Slack Channel**: [e.g., #project-customer-portal]

## Additional Notes

[Any other project-specific information that would help AI generate better code]

Example:
- Customer prefers verbose error messages
- All dates should be in MM/DD/YYYY format (US customer)
- Currency always in USD with $ symbol
- Use customer's brand colors: #FF6B6B (primary), #4ECDC4 (secondary)
