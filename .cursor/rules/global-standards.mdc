# Global Base Rules

These rules apply to ALL projects, regardless of language or framework.

## General Coding Standards

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
- Avoid single-letter names except for loop counters (i, j, k)
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and components
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

### Code Organization
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Maximum function length: 50 lines (prefer 20-30)
- Group related code together
- Use clear section comments for major blocks

### Comments
- Write comments for complex logic or non-obvious decisions
- Explain WHY, not WHAT (code should be self-explanatory)
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Use TODO comments for future improvements

### Error Handling
- Always handle errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with sufficient context
- Never swallow errors silently

## Security Best Practices

### Never Hardcode Secrets
- No API keys, passwords, or tokens in code
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Add .env files to .gitignore

### Input Validation
- Validate all user input
- Sanitize data before processing
- Use parameterized queries for databases

### Authentication & Authorization
- Always verify user permissions
- Use secure session management
- Implement proper logout functionality

## Code Quality

### Readability
- Write code for humans first, computers second
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Use consistent formatting

### Maintainability
- Avoid code duplication (DRY principle)
- Make code easy to test
- Document complex algorithms

### Performance
- Optimize only when necessary (measure first)
- Avoid premature optimization
- Profile before optimizing

## Git Commit Messages

### Format
```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Formatting changes
- refactor: Code restructuring
- test: Adding tests
- chore: Maintenance tasks

### Examples
```
feat: Add user authentication

Implemented JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens.
Added login, logout, and token refresh endpoints.

Closes #123
```

## Testing

### Write Tests
- Write tests for new features
- Maintain existing tests
- Aim for meaningful coverage (not just high %)

### Test Naming
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow pattern: "should [expected behavior] when [condition]"

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Document public APIs
- Include usage examples
- Keep documentation in sync with code

### README Files
- Every project should have a README
- Include: purpose, setup, usage, contributing

## AI Assistance Guidelines

### When Generating Code
- Follow all rules above
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements unclear
- Suggest best practices and alternatives
- Explain complex code with comments

### Code Reviews
- Point out potential issues
- Suggest improvements
- Explain reasoning for suggestions
